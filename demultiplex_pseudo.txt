THE PROBLEM:
We're identifying index hopping and binning those files, as well as using barcodes
to demuliplex into 24 samples.


OUTPUT:
We want to use barcodes to know which sequences came from which samples after
they had all been sequenced together.


FUNCTIONS:

Return TRUE if the index q score and sequence q score match
Return FALSE if the index q score and sequence q score don't match

Return TRUE if indexes are in the list of 24

Return a string if reverse complement

PSEUDOCODE:

Open 4 FASTQ files

Record One = []

if the sequence and index q scores return TRUE:
  if the reverse complement of index 2 = index 1:
    save forward and reverse to a match file
  else:
    save forward and reverse to an index-hopped file
else:
  save to an unknown file

GIVEN FILES:

48 files
- four input fastq files
  2 with biological reads, 2 with
index reads)

- 24 known indexes in a file


OUTPUT:

per matching index pair
- 1 forward fastq file
- 1 reverse fastq file

per non-matching index pair (index hopping)
- 1 forward fastq file
- 1 reverse fastq file

unknown files
- read 2 doesn't match the knowns or meet q score cut-off
- read 3 doesn't match the knowns or meet q score cut-off


add index-pair sequence to header of:
- index1 file
- index2 file

test files
4 files like R1, R2, R3, R4

1 index-hopped
1 unknown
1 match
